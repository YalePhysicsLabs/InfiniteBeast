# The Infinite Beast
A Driven Chaotic Pendulum 
![Assembled Device](/AssembledDevice.png)
This project describes how to build a driven chaotic pendulum that has a circuit that can self start from rest and will oscillate chaotically for as long as the battery lasts. The description and instructions can be found in the file InfiniteBeast.pdf. The gerber files necessary to manufacture the PCB boards are also included.

A stop-motion video of the assembly process can be found on Youtube at:
